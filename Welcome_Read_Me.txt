Welcome to my LeetCode directory!

Here, I explore more ideas and expand my understanding with LeetCode. 

In order to fully understand my answers, I have included my thought process
in the txt file along with each of my recent Python code. Occasionally, if I find that 
a question is particularly difficult to understand for me, I will write down a 
step-by-step example to write down how my code works so that I can fully
break down the question and understand how to attempt the question if I were
to go back to it at a future date.


Have a look around!
