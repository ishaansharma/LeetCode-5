39. Combination Sum

  Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a 
  list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. 
  You may return the combinations in any order.
  The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations 
  are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
  It is guaranteed that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 
  150 combinations for the given input.
  
  Constraints:
  1 <= candidates.length <= 30
  1 <= candidates[i] <= 200
  All elements of candidates are distinct.
  1 <= target <= 500

Thought Process
- I want all the unique combinations of candidates to be equal to the target.
  - Therefore, when the total sum, 'total', is equal to the target, 'target', I
  want to append the list of candidates to the result variable, 'res'.
- If the sum of the candidates are greater than the target, I want to
move back and try the next candidate in the array.
- After iterating through all possible combinations, I want to return the result
variable, 'res'.
