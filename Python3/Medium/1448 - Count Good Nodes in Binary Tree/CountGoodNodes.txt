1448 - Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

  Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X 
  there are no nodes with a value greater than X.
  
  Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.
  
  Constraints:

  The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range [1, 10^5].
  Each node's value is between [-10^4, 10^4].
  
Time Complexity - O(n)          Space Complexity - O(n)
- where 'n' is the amount of nodes


Thought Process
- For this question, I want to do recursive DFS.
- I need to have a maximum value that will be used to compared with the 
values in the tree.
  - If I find a greater value than the current maximum value, I can
  set that value to the maximum value.
