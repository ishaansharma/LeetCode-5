659 Â· Encode and Decode Strings

Description
Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.
Please implement encode and decode


Time Complexity - O(n), where n stands for the total amount of characters

Thought Process
Encode - For each string in the list of strings, append the length of the string and a random symbol, and then the string to a new list.

Decode - Set two points, i and j. One pointer will be set to the length of the string, the other pointer will be on the index after the first pointer. i and j 
would be used to find the length of the string. By using str[j + 1 : j + length + 1], we can find the string, because since j is at the symbol '#', j+1 would
be the first letter of the string, and j + length + 1 would be the index after the last character of the string (up to but not including). I would append this
string to a list. Then, I will set 'i' to the index after the last character of the string. The while loop would continue this until int 'i' breaks out of the
while loop, and at last, it would append the list 'res' that was used to store all of the strings.
