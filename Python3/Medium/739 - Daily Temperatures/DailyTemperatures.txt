739. Daily Temperatures

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, 
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have 
to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future
day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.


Time Complexity - O(n)                Space Complexity - O(n)
  - where n is equal to the length of the array of integers
  
  
Thought Process
- I want to find the number of days I have to wait after the ith day to get a
warmer temperature.
- I can use a stack to solve this problem.
- Since the stack is going to be monotonic decreasing stack, I can check if the
current temperature is greater than the temperature on top of the stack.
  - If so, I can pop the top of the stack and take the current day subtracted 
  by the previous day at the index of the previous day.
  - I can continue checking if the current temperature is greater than the 
  previous temperature until the condition is not fulfilled.
- After each iteration, I can append the current day and temperature as a list
to the stack.
- After completely iterating through the for loop, I can return the result,
res, which includes the day and the ith day after in which there is 
a warmer temperature.
