973. K Closest Points to Origin

  Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane 
  and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

  The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

  You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).
  
  Constraints:

  1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
  -104 < xi, yi < 104
  
  
Thought Process
- Since I am returning the kth closest points, I can use a heap.
- First, I want to calculate the distance for each of the points.
  - I want to append the distance, x, and y to a empty list, 'values'.
- Now, I will create a new empty list, 'res' to store all the coordinates
that I will be returning.
- I can first heapify 'values'.
  - Now, all of the distances are sorted from least to greatest.
- To return the first k closest points, I can pop 'k' amount the points from
from 'values' and then append the x and y to my result variable, 'res'.
- After popping the first k closest points, I can return 'res'. 

Time Complexity - O(nlogk)
  - Heapify -> O(n)
    -> n = amount of points
  - Pop -> O(logk)
    -> k = k closest points
Space Complexity - O(n)
