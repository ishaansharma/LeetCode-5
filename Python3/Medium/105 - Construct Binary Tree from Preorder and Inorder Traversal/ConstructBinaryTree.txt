105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

  Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal 
  of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.
  
  Constraints:

  1 <= preorder.length <= 3000
  inorder.length == preorder.length
  -3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000
  preorder and inorder consist of unique values.
  Each value of inorder also appears in preorder.
  preorder is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.
  inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.

Time Complexity - O(n)            Space Complexity - O(n)

Thought Process
- I know that preorder is root -> left -> right, which means that the first node in the
preorder array is the root.
- Inorder is left -> root -> right.
- To construct and find the binary tree, I have to find the index of the root in the inorder
array.
  - To find the left children of the root, I can take all the nodes up to root.
  - To find the right children of the root, I can take all the nodes from the right of the root to 
  the end of the inorder array.
- To return the binary tree, I can return root.
