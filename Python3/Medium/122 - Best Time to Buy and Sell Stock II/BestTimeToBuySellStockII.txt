122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the 
stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day. Find and return 
the maximum profit you can achieve.

Time Complexity - O(n), where n is the length of the list.
Space Complexity - O(1), because no extra memory is needed.

Thought Process
- I can buy a stock whenever there is a profit.
  - I can use a for loop to iterate through the first item to the last item of the list.
    - Why first item?
      - I am going to check the stock's price the previous day so starting at index 0 is not necessary.
    - If the current value of a stock is greater than the previous day, that means there is a profit.
      - Thus, I can add the profit to our result variable.
  - After breaking out the for loop, I can return the maximum profit variable, 'res'.
