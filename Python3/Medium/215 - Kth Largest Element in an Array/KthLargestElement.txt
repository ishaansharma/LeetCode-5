215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

  Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

  Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
  
  Constraints:
  1 <= k <= nums.length <= 104
  -104 <= nums[i] <= 104

Thought Process
- If I want to return the kth largest element, I can use heap sort.
- First, I can heapify the array.
  - To find the kth largest element, I have to make the size of the heap the same size
  as 'k'.
    - After heapifying, the heap is sorted from least to greatest.
    - So while the size of the heap is greater than 'k', I can keep popping the first value
    in the heap, which is the current smallest value in the heap.
  - Once the size of the heap is the same size as 'k', I can return the first value in the heap.


Time Complexity - O(nlogn)
  Heapify -> O(n)
  Pop -> O(logn)
