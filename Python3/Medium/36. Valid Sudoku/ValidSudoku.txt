36. Valid Sudoku

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.


Thought Process 
I will have to check each value at each row for any repetition in any of the row. Check each column and subbox for any repetitions as well.

If we are checking for distinct values, maybe I can use a hash set? If there is a value that repeats, I can return False, otherwise continue.
