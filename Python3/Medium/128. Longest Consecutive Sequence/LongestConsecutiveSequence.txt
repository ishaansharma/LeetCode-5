128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Time Complexity - O(n)
Space Complexity - O(n), where n is the size of the array

Thought Process 
- Create a set version of the array. 
- Iterate through the array.
  - Since I can find out the start of the consecutive sequence by first checking if any number before an number exists by using the set, I can use
    a while loop to iterate through the sequence and break out of the for loop when the next number doesn't exist in the set. 
  - I can keep track of the length by using two variables, longest and length. Longest would be used to track the longest consecutive elements sequence, 
    while length will be used to track the current consecutive elements sequence. I can compare long and longest to each other using the max() method.
  - After iterating through the entire array, I can return the variable 'longest'.
