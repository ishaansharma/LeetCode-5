136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Time Complexity - O(n)                Space Complexity - O(1)

Thought Process
- To solve this question efficiently, I can use the XOR operator.
  - What does the XOR operator do?
    - Takes a integer as a binary number.
      - Compares the integer with another integer (also as binary number)
        - Say the first binary number is '101' and the second binary number is '001'
          - XOR compares the digit in each place value.
            - If the digit is equal to each other (1 = 1 or 0 = 0), the digit becomes 0.
            - If the digit isn't equal to each other (0 != 1, 1 != 0), the digit becomes 1.
          - Thus, the result would be '100'.
- Compare each number with XOR operator and return the final result.
