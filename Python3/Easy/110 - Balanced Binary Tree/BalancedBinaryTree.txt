110. Balanced Binary Tree

  Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
  For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
  a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.
  
  
Time Complexity - O(n), where n is the amount of nodes          Space Complexity - O(h), where h is the height


Thought Process
- For this question, the question asks a height-balanced binary tree is when
the left and right subtrees differ in height no more than 1.
- Therefore, I want to use recursion DFS to work my way up and find the height
of the left side and the right side.
  - If these two sides subtracted by each other is ever greater than 1, I can
  return False.
  - Otherwise, if the condition is never valid, I can return True.
