Question
    Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome
    when it reads the same backward as forward.

    Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

    Constraints:
        - -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

Thoughts Before Coding
    - A palindrome is a string that can be read the same way forwards and backwards
        - This means if we reverse 'x'
            - The reverse version of 'x' will be equal to 'x'
    - We will implement the approach that does not require us to convert integer to a string
        - How can we reverse 'x'?
            - We can create a variable 'reverse' to keep track of reverse form of 'x'
            - We will need to process the digits of 'x' from right -> left
                - In order to retrieve the rightmost digit, we can use the modulus operator
                    - rightmost digit = x % 10
                - Multiple 'reverse' by 10, then increment by rightmost 'digit'
                - Remove the rightmost 'x' using the division operator
                    - x = x / 10
        - After, we process all of the digits of 'x'
            - We will compare 'x' with reverse form

Answer
    - Lets validate the input parameter
        - if 'x' is negative,
            - Return false
    - Create two variables
        - copy, equals to 'x'
        - reverse, reverse form of 'x'
    - While 'copy' is greater than 0
        - Retrieve the rightmost digit
             - digit = copy % 10
        - Multiply 'reverse' by 10 and then increment by 'digit'
        - Remove rightmost digit
            - copy = copy / 10
    - Return true if 'reverse' is equal to 'x'
        - Else, return false

What is the Time and Space Complexity?
    - Time Complexity = O(logx), where x is the input value
        - O(logx), process each of the digits of 'x'
    - Space Complexity = O(1)
