84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height 
where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

 
 Time Complexity - O(n)
 Space Complexity - O(n)
 
 
Thought Process
- I have to return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.
- One thing that I have to note is that this will be a monotonic increasing
stack.
 - If the height is less than the previous height, I want to multiply the
 height by the current index subtracted by the previous index.
   - Whenever a greater max area is found, set it to the max area variable maxArea.
 - I can find the previous height and index by appending these two values into my
 stack.
- Once I have iterated the input array, I can return the max area, 'maxArea'.
